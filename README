Introducing The Kickoff Agenda Builder:

A kick-off meeting is a crucial moment in any web project. However, 
making sure you cover all of the bases can be challenging.

Done right the kick-off meeting at project commencement can overcome 
a lot of these issues. It can lay a solid groundwork for the project 
ensuring that everybody is singing off of the same hymn sheet and 
putting in place lines of communication that will last the 
entire project.

Can You Improve It?:

No doubt we have missed stuff so if you think of anything we should 
include, feel free to fork this project and submit a pull request. 
We fancy turning this into a proper web app that allows agendas to be 
saved online for specific clients (SQLite or WebStorage, perhaps?). 
We would love to merge your work here if you have something useful 
to add.
